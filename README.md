EthWorks recruitment test.

Libraries and tools that I used to complete the task:

- HTML5 (using semantics tags)
- CSS3 with SCSS
- BEM methodology
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Slick Slider
- Animate.css
- Wow.js
- Gulp

The web-page itself is adapted for phones, tablets and desktop.
Used mobile first approach.
Added favicon, "meta tags" and some simple animations (Animate.css + Wow.js).

Pixel Perfect approach was applied as much as possible (inaccuracies in the layout).
Used google chrome plugin - Perfect Pixel.

Video in modal window was taken from youtube.
Implemented with a script that replaces the src link in the iframe tag.
Autoplay turned on.
