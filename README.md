EthWorks recruitment test.

Libraries and tools that I used to complete the task:

- HTML5 (using semantics)
- CSS3 with SCSS
- BEM methodology
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Slick Slider
- Animate.css
- Wow.js
- Gulp

The web-page itself is adapted for phones, tablets and desktop.

Pixel Perfect approach was applied as much as possible.
